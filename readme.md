Hi Wes!

Here is my project 3! I just want to thank you not only for the teaching in class but the awesome React course that I took online. I plan on spending my time off from HackerYou exploring all your great online resources and continuing to grow as a developer!

Things I didn't accomplish/didn't do on my own:

-the ES6 aspects in React - towards the end of the React course I choose to write the code as I initially learned it - mostly due to being pressed for time. Though I will convert them over the next few days.

-I used your devDependencies from the React course - though not sure I need everything in there. Looking to learn more about understanding building my own package.json/node_modules based on what I want/need to accomplish. Before I even really started this App I didn't really get it but now looking at it - it makes more sense!

- I bet my SASS isn't nested perfectly or as dry as it could be. I styled the results populating before it populating which put me in a position to update my css that may have lost its beauty in the process.

I would love if in your response to this project that you can send me some challenges/advice for next steps.

I can't wait to start to apply for roles - but over the next few months I want to refine my ability to communicate verbally about languages as thought I have a grasp I feel like I need to really be able to explain what is going on. 

Thanks again and I hope to take another course with you in the future!

I'm sad its over for now! ðŸ˜°
